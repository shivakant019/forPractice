Q1 Find all interleaving of given strings that can be formed from all the characters of the first and second string where the order of characters is preserved.

 

 

Input: str1 = "AB",  str2 = "CD"
Output:
    ABCD
    ACBD
    ACDB
    CABD
    CADB
    CDAB
Input: str1 = "AB",  str2 = "C"
Output:
    ABC
    ACB
    CAB
 

 


Q2. Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

 



Q3. You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.


 


 

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6}, K = 3 
Output: 3 3 4 5 5 5 6
Explanation: 
Maximum of 1, 2, 3 is 3
Maximum of 2, 3, 1 is 3
Maximum of 3, 1, 4 is 4
Maximum of 1, 4, 5 is 5
Maximum of 4, 5, 2 is 5 
Maximum of 5, 2, 3 is 5
Maximum of 2, 3, 6 is 6
Input: arr[] = {8, 5, 10, 7, 9, 4, 15, 12, 90, 13}, K = 4 
Output: 10 10 10 15 15 90 90
Explanation:
Maximum of first 4 elements is 10, similarly for next 4 
elements (i.e from index 1 to 4) is 10, So the sequence 
generated is 10 10 10 15 15 90 90



Return the max sliding window.
